# The CLI Library

This is an accompanying CLI app for the [advanced typescript blog post]().

## Setup

To run this app you'll need Node v18, and I recommend getting [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) as well,
but replacing pnpm with npm below will work as well.

```sh
brew instll pnpm
```

To run the app, run the following:

- Clone this repository (`git clone ...`)
- Open a terminal in the directory of the app (`cd typescript-library-app`)
- Install dependencies (`pnpm install`)
- Run the app! (`pnpm run src`)
