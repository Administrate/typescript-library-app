# The CLI Library

This is an accompanying CLI app for the [advanced typescript blog post](https://engineering.getadministrate.com/typescript/2023/04/06/advanced-typescript.html).

## Setup

To run this app you'll need Node v18, and I recommend getting [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) as well,
but replacing pnpm with npm below will work as well.

```sh
brew install pnpm
```

To run the app, run the following:

- Clone this repository (`git clone ...`)
- Open a terminal in the directory of the app (`cd typescript-library-app`)
- Install dependencies (`pnpm install`)
- Run the app! (`pnpm run src`)
